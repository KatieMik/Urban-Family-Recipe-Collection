recipe001,recipe001.pdf,application/pdf,KSB (Kale Sausage Beans),Kristine Makiewicz,"This recipe I found on a blog I’ve read for years “A Cup of Jo."" They titled it “This Dinner is so good, It has a nickname!” When I first read the recipe I wasn’t totally convinced, but we made it once and it became a staple. Once Kurt and I started loving KSB we became KSB evangelists! What I love now it that there are at least 3-4 friend / family groups that now have KSB as part of their go-to dinner recipes. We get messages all the time, ‘It’s a KSB night!” We love it with spicy Italian sausage, two bunches of kale and two cans of beans to really get the ratio right""",Entree,kale; sausage; beans,Spring; Fall; Winter,stovetop,

recipe003,recipe003.pdf,application/pdf,Stuffed Cabbage Leaves (Gołąbki),Josh Clary,Our friends Jack and Kelly who lived in Romania for years introduced us to this dish and we make it often.

recipe004,recipe004.pdf,application/pdf,Baked Tofu with Peanut Sauce and Coconut-Lime Rice,Laura Urban,"I’m always looking for new interesting ways to eat this low-on-the-food-chain and so-healthy protein. Tofu is like a blank slate that plays well with strong flavors, so spicy peanut butter makes for an easy sauce. With the raw greens and hot coconutty-rice, the mix of textures is really satisfying. This is one of my new favorite go-to options.",Entree,tofu; peanut; cocunut; lime; rice,All Seasons,stovetop; oven,

recipe006,recipe006.pdf,application/pdf,Glazed Sweet Potato with Lentils,Leslie Urban,"As someone who has always pooh-poohed lentils, this is the recipe that made me a convert. I’ll often bake the sweet potatoes as soon as I get home from the grocery, so on the evening I am eating it all it takes is the 20ish minutes it takes to cook the lentils to throw this all together.",Entree,lentils; sweet potato,Fall; Winter,stovetop; oven,
recipe007,recipe007.pdf,application/pdf,Farmer’s Market Frittata,Katie Mikulka; Emy Urban,"Emy and I have started making frittatas whenever we need a quick dinner or/and have a surplus of languishing produce. Both factors are usually in play on Friday nights, when both energy and fresh groceries are dangerously low. But its four portions are perfect for dinner on Friday and reheated leftovers make for a post Farmer’s Market brunch on Saturday. The veggie, dairy, and cheese combinations are endless here. But be aware of the moisture content, as that can prevent the frittata from setting. An overzealous attempt to use up a lot of tomatoes taught us that lesson the hard way... Leafy greens— like collards, spinach, and kale—shine here, as do onions, peppers, and mushrooms. Leftover meat or browned sausage would also be a delight! The options are endless. Serve with toast or potatoes.would also be a delight! The options are endless. Serve with toast or potatoes.would also be a delight! The options are endless.

recipe013,recipe013.pdf,application/pdf,Butternut Squash Soup,Katie Mikulka; Emy Urban,"This fall, Katie and I have gotten quite a few squashes in our CSA and we’ve found this soup is an easy and delicious way to use it up. The ginger and the rosemary/sage make for such a good flavor combination and we use our immersion blender to make it super creamy. We eat it with a side of crusty bread with butter.

recipe019,recipe019.pdf,application/pdf,Katie’s Caramelized Onion Dip,Katie Mikulka,"Onion dip is perhaps one of earth’s most perfect foods. This version, simplified and adapted from Alison Roman, is next level: sweet from the caramelized onions, a little spicy from the raw garlic, and incredibly creamy from the mix of dairy. Cooking the onions is time-consuming, but well worth it. Listen to a podcast while you stir, and your patience will be rewarded.",Appetizer/Snack,onion,All Seasons,stovetop,
